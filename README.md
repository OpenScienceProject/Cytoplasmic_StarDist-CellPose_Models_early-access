# Cytoplasmic_StarDist-CellPose_Models_early-access

These models are intended to be used in QuPath running the StarDist Extension on multiplex images (original data on multispectral images).

"CD45" is a polyvalent model trained on lymphoid cells and myeloid cells. I use it for macrophages detection.

"CD8" and "CD20" are models that are more fitted on lymphocytes, I use them respectivelly for T cells and B cells detection.
